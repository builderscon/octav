# What's With The Name?

Eh, don't worry. Just a word that I came up with, and has absolutely no meaning.Feel free to suggest a better name

# Features

## MUST HAVE

* Administrators can register "organizers"
* Organizers can create/update/delete "conferences"
* Organizers can register "venues" (which has one ore more "rooms")
* Speakers can register themselves ("speakers")
* Speakers can submit talk proposals ("sessions"). Proposals can be either hidden or visible. If hidden, we need a "make schedule visible" button
* Organizers can accept/reject talk proposals
* Organizers can edit talk proposals, to set date/time, etc.
* Accepted talks show up in schedule
* Sessions can have, among other things, video urls and slide urls. These can be shown as a list. It can be grouped by tags, too.
* Conferences have "news feed", "Twitter/Social Network Feed display"
* Speakers can register their photo, bio. Must register email (not public, only used to send notices from organizers)

## NICE TO HAVE
